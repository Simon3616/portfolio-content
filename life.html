			<h1>Basketball</h1>
			<p>Playing basketball is my favorite sport. As long as I don't fight for a day, I will always feel uncomfortable and uneasy.
				I watch the "Basketball Park" program on TV every Monday. My favorite thing to watch is NBA basketball games. In NBA basketball games, superstars gather, and every game is very exciting and fascinating. I admire many basketball stars, such as basketball trapeze Michael Jordan, rebounding King Dennis Rodman and so on. ?
				I started playing basketball in 1st grade. At that time, my shooting percentage was very low, let alone ball handling skills. Due to my unremitting efforts in these two years, my basketball skills have improved a lot. I often play basketball with some junior high school students.

			<h1>Snowboard</h1>
			<p>
				On Christmas 1965, the Sherman Poppen family of Muskegon, Michigan, finished singing Christmas carols as the children unwrapped Santa's presents, snowboards! The two daughters were very happy. He took the children up the mountain to ski. Poppen had an idea, tied the two skis together and combined them into one, and then improved it. It was designed as a single-piece board that was shorter and wider than traditional skis, and it was equipped with ropes for steering. . The neighborhood kids are clamoring for this very fun new toy. In 1966, Sherman patented his idea for a surf-style ski. His wife suggested combining the English words "snow" and "surf," and Snurfer was born. Poppen licensed his invention to the Brunswick Corporation, and it became a hit, selling nearly a million copies by 1970.

			<h1>Cooking</h1>
			<p>
				I like to open the refrigerator and see that it is full of various ingredients, and I like the neat arrangement of bottles and jars on the cabinets and stove. This small space, only a few square meters, seems to be more interesting as it gets more crowded. If a person's kitchen is deserted, it is difficult for him to live a hot life. And cooking, which uses the kitchen as a carrier, can better reflect people's attitude towards life. People have learned to cook food since the Stone Age, but real cooking is an art. Everyone who loves to cook is an artist who takes life seriously. Those various ingredients need to be careful about the choice of salt and sugar, so that they can be fried and cooked to convey temperature and love. Mouthwateringly delicious. The American poet Wendell Berry once said: "It is absurd to be interested in food, but not in cooking." Can make so many delicious, that kind of joy and soothing mood.

				What I want to eat and what my family likes to eat, I can do it myself. Every time I make progress, every time I get affirmation, it is a joy that cannot be compared with just "eating".
