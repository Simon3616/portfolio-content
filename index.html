		<h1>Simeng Zhao</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Simeng Zhao, a master student from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor majored in mechanical engineering. 
			I am pursuing a full-time position as a software engineer. I have laid a solid foundation in mathematics and cultivated the logical ability to write codes in the study of this major. Through cross-subject courses, software development projects, online courses ，and self-study, I have a deep understanding of algorithms and software development，and have a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning. I have a wide range of software development project experience, including recommendation systems, full-stack web application development with Spring, React, MySQL, and machine learning. Familiar with Java, Python as well as  C++, I think I have the ability to be a great team member and write efficient code.
